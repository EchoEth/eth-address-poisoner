## ⚠️ Warning: Use Responsibly & Ethically! ⚠️

This tool is designed **strictly for educational purposes and authorized security research**. ETH Address Poisoning is a deceptive technique that can cause significant financial loss if used maliciously.

*   🛑 **DO NOT** use this tool against any individual or entity without their explicit, written permission.
*   ⚖️ Unauthorized use is **illegal and unethical**. You are solely responsible for your actions.
*   🛡️ The primary goal is to **understand the attack vector** to build better defenses and raise user awareness.
*   🎓 Use this tool to learn, test your own security assumptions (on testnets or with owned addresses), or during authorized penetration testing engagements.

# **If you are interested in buying this tool, you may contact me on telegram at @migrainedev to discuss.**

**The developers assume NO liability and are NOT responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this tool.**

## 🤔 What is ETH Address Poisoning?

ETH Address Poisoning is a social engineering attack targeting cryptocurrency users. It exploits the common habit of users copying addresses from their transaction history rather than verifying them fully each time.

**Here's the attack flow:**

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies a target address (Victim).
2.  **Vanity Address Generation:** The attacker generates a large number of Ethereum addresses (`AttackerVanityAddr`) that visually mimic the Victim's address (or an address the Victim frequently interacts with). Usually, the first few and last few characters match (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).
3.  **The "Poison" Transaction:** The attacker sends a tiny (often zero-value) amount of ETH or a token *from* their `AttackerVanityAddr` *to* the Victim's address.
4.  **The Trap:** This transaction now appears in the Victim's wallet history. The `AttackerVanityAddr` looks very similar to an address the Victim trusts or uses often.
5.  **The Mistake:** Later, when the Victim intends to send a *significant* amount of funds to their intended recipient, they might quickly glance at their history, see the familiar-looking `AttackerVanityAddr`, copy it, and paste it into the recipient field without careful verification.
6.  **Funds Lost:** The Victim unknowingly sends their funds to the attacker's vanity address instead of the legitimate recipient.

**Why it's effective:**

*   **User Habit:** Relies on the shortcut of copy-pasting from history.
*   **Visual Deception:** Long hexadecimal addresses are hard to compare character-by-character. Matching start/end characters often provide a false sense of security.
*   **Wallet UI:** Some wallets truncate addresses in the UI, making the similar parts more prominent.

## ⚙️ How EtherEcho Works

`EtherEcho` automates the crucial steps of an address poisoning *simulation* for security testing:

1.  **🎯 Input:** You provide the target address you want to simulate the attack against (e.g., an address you own on a testnet for research). Optionally, you can provide addresses the target frequently interacts with (counterparties) to generate even more deceptive vanity addresses.
2.  **🔑 Vanity Address Generation:** `EtherEcho` utilizes efficient algorithms [Mention specific method if applicable, e.g., multi-threaded CPU or GPU generation] to generate vanity addresses that match the first `N` and last `M` characters of the target address *or* its counterparties.
3.  **💸 Transaction Crafting:** It connects to an Ethereum node (via RPC URL) using a provided private key (which needs a small amount of ETH for gas).
4.  **☣️ Poisoning Simulation:** For each generated vanity address, it sends a minimal (configurable, near-zero) value ETH transaction *from* the vanity address *to* the target address. This populates the target's transaction history with these look-alike addresses.
5.  **📊 Logging & Output:** Provides clear logs of generated addresses, transaction hashes, and success/failure status.

## 🚀 Key Features: Why EtherEcho Stands Out

*   ✨ **High-Performance Generation:** Optimized vanity address generation [mention specifics like 'multi-core support' or 'GPU acceleration via XYZ' if true]. Find matching addresses faster.
*   🎯 **Advanced Targeting:** Poison based on the target *or* their frequent counterparties for more realistic simulation scenarios.
*   🔧 **Highly Configurable:**
    *   Set custom prefix/suffix lengths for vanity addresses.
    *   Adjust the tiny ETH value sent in poisoning transactions.
    *   Configure gas price/limit settings.
    *   Specify custom RPC endpoints (Mainnet, Testnets, Local).
*   🌐 **Network Flexibility:** Works with any EVM-compatible chain via RPC (Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon, BSC, etc.).
*   🔐 **Security Focused:** Designed for researchers and blue teams to understand and test defenses. **Does not store private keys persistently** [Verify this is true for your tool].
*   📈 **Clear Logging:** Verbose output detailing the process, generated addresses, and transaction hashes for analysis.
*   🐍 **Clean Python Codebase:** Easy to understand, modify, and contribute to.
